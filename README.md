# ![Lucky Strike Logo](icons/icon48.png) Lucky Strike
A Chrome extension that redirects omnibox queries to Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky". Download it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lucky-strike/heijciabceepcblmjfndmmkmacnfniom?hl=en).

Lucky Strike saves your most recent query, so you can view full search results by clicking the extension's browser button. After installing it on Chrome, follow the [setup instructions](http://www.google.com/lucky-strike-extension/) (will load only after installing the extension) to set Lucky Strike as your default search provider.

The Lucky Strike logo is based on an icon by [Edward Boatman](http://thenounproject.com/edward) and is used here under [Creative Commons â€“ Attribution (CC BY 3.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/).
