# lucky-strike
Chrome extension that redirects omnibox queries to Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky"

The most recent query is saved, so you can view full search results by clicking the extension's browser button.

The `l` keyword is required to direct queries to Lucky Strike. When I wrote this code, the Chrome Developer API did not allow extensions to set their omnibox handler as the default search engine.
